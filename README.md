# Simple Cell Segmentation using U-Net

## Introduction
This project focuses on identifying each pixel in a grayscale image as cell or background, showcasing the capabilities of U-Net architecture in binary classification.

## Approach
Working with grayscale images, the objective is to craft corresponding masks that accurately depict cell boundaries, utilizing the U-Net model for its exceptional ability to balance context capture and precise localization.

## Importing Dependencies
Critical Python libraries and frameworks used include torch, torchvision, PIL, and matplotlib, essential for processing and visualizing the grayscale images and their masks.

## Dataset Preparation
A custom ImgDataset class orchestrates the handling of image and mask directories, incorporating transformations to standardize input data for optimal model training and validation.

## Model Architecture
Leveraging the U-Net architecture, known for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation, the model includes an encoder for context capture, a bottleneck for feature processing, and a decoder to reconstruct the segmentation mask, with dropout layers to mitigate overfitting.

## Training the Model
The model is trained with a batch size of 1, using the Adam optimizer and the BCEWithLogitsLoss function. It involves a forward pass to generate predictions, calculating loss, and performing a backward pass for optimization. Training and validation phases assess performance through loss metrics, IoU, Dice Coefficient, Precision, and Recall to refine and validate the model's effectiveness.

## Making Predictions
Post-training, the model can predict segmentation masks for new images. The output is processed through a sigmoid function and thresholded to distinguish cells from the background.

## Challenges and Solutions
The project addresses common deep learning challenges such as overfitting and underfitting, employing strategies like early stopping and hyperparameter tuning to ensure robust model performance.

## Applications and Conclusion
This work underscores the impactful role of deep learning in medical imaging, particularly in automating cell analysis for quicker, more accurate diagnostics. Future enhancements could include data augmentation, transfer learning, and model deployment for broader application in real-world medical analysis contexts.
